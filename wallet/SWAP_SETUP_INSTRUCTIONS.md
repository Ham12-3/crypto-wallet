# Swap Page Setup Instructions

The swap page has been successfully created and matches the design from image.png! Here's what was implemented:

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Swap BLoC (State Management)**
- `swap_event.dart` - Events for loading data, updating amounts, selecting currencies, swapping, and executing trades
- `swap_state.dart` - State management for currencies, amounts, exchange rates, and network fees
- `swap_bloc.dart` - Business logic for calculating exchange rates and handling swaps

### 2. **UI Components**
- `swap_screen.dart` - Main swap page matching the exact design from image.png
  - "You Send" section with amount input and currency selector
  - Swap direction button (arrow icon)
  - "You Receive" section with calculated amount
  - Exchange rate and network fee display
  - Blue swap button
  - Bottom navigation bar

- `currency_selector.dart` - Dropdown widget for selecting cryptocurrencies
  - Shows currency icon, symbol, and name
  - Displays balance and USD value
  - Modal bottom sheet for selection

### 3. **Navigation**
- Added `/swap` route to app_routes.dart
- Integrated navigation from portfolio screen (Swap tab at index 2)

## Design Matches
The implementation closely matches your image.png design:
- âœ… Header with "Swap" title, notification bell, and profile picture
- âœ… "You Send" section with balance display (2.5 ETH)
- âœ… Amount input (1.0000)
- âœ… Currency selector with ETH/Ethereum dropdown
- âœ… Swap direction arrow button
- âœ… "You Receive" section with balance (5000 USDT)
- âœ… Calculated amount display (3000.00)
- âœ… Exchange rate: 1 ETH â‰ˆ 3000 USDT
- âœ… Network fee: 0.001 ETH
- âœ… Blue "Swap" button
- âœ… Bottom navigation: Portfolio, Trade, Swap (active), Recent, Settings

## Next Steps

### 1. Add Cryptocurrency Icons
You need to add icon images to `assets/images/`:
- `eth_icon.png` - Ethereum logo
- `usdt_icon.png` - Tether logo
- `btc_icon.png` - Bitcoin logo
- `bnb_icon.png` - Binance Coin logo

You can download these from cryptocurrency icon libraries or create simple circular icons with the currency symbols.

### 2. Run the App
```bash
cd wallet
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### 3. Test Navigation
1. Start the app and login
2. Navigate to Portfolio screen
3. Tap the "Swap" tab in the bottom navigation
4. You should see the swap page matching the design

### 4. Test Functionality
- Try changing the "You Send" amount - the "You Receive" amount should update
- Tap on currency selectors to see the currency picker
- Try swapping currencies using the arrow button
- Test the swap execution by tapping the blue "Swap" button

## Current Mock Data
The app currently uses mock data with these currencies:
- ETH (Ethereum) - Balance: 2.5, Price: $3000
- USDT (Tether) - Balance: 5000, Price: $1
- BTC (Bitcoin) - Balance: 0.5, Price: $68500
- BNB (Binance Coin) - Balance: 10, Price: $600

To connect to real data, you'll need to:
1. Create a swap repository implementation
2. Connect to a cryptocurrency price API
3. Integrate with your wallet's actual balances
4. Implement real swap execution logic
